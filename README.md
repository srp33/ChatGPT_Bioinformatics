# Using ChatGPT for basic bioinformatics tasks

Data and code from the preprint [Many bioinformatics programming tasks can be automated with ChatGPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13528). This manuscript is currently under review at an academic journal, so we will be posting updates as we proceed through the review stages. For now, we are hiding the instructors' solutions so that students cannot see the solutions for those few that ChatGPT did not solve. But if you are interested in seeing them, [contact me](https://lifesciences.byu.edu/directory/stephen-piccolo).
