# 10 - Dictionaries

**Human:**
Here is a new Python programming task.

Please write a function called "createAnimalDict". Your function should accept no arguments.

Your function should create a dictionary. Each key in the dictionary should be the name of an adult animal. Each value in the dictionary should be the term used to describe the baby of a given animal. Your dictionary should contain the following (adult) animal names: dog, cat, horse, pig, bear, and alligator. The baby names for each of these are puppy, kitten, foal, piglet, cub, and hatchling, respectively. Your function should return this dictionary.

Below is a description of a test to verify your code.

For this test, the following code will be executed after your code:

    print(createAnimalDict())

Below is the expected output:

    {'dog': 'puppy', 'cat': 'kitten', 'horse': 'foal', 'pig': 'piglet', 'bear': 'cub', 'alligator': 'hatchling'}

***

**Assistant:**

Here is a Python function that implements the requirements you described:

```
def createAnimalDict():
    animal_dict = {
        'dog': 'puppy',
        'cat': 'kitten',
        'horse': 'foal',
        'pig': 'piglet',
        'bear': 'cub',
        'alligator': 'hatchling'
    }
    return animal_dict

```

When this function is executed, it will return a dictionary with the specified keys and values.


***

**Human:**
Here is a new Python programming task.

Please write a function called "getBabyName". This function should accept two arguments: 1) a dictionary and 2) a string. The dictionary will specify adult animal names as the keys. The values will be the respective baby names (as in the dictionary you created in the previous exercise). The second argument will be one of the adult animal names.

Your function should return a string indicating the baby name corresponding to the specified adult name (as shown in the expected output). If there are no matches for the adult name in the dictionary, return "No match".

**Assistant:**

```
def getBabyName(d, animal):
    if animal in d:
        return "The baby name for " + animal + " is " + d[animal] + "."
    else:
        return "No match"

```

**Human:**
Here is a new Python programming task.

Please write a function called "mergeDictionaries" that accepts two arguments. Each of these arguments will be dictionary variables. Your function should use for loop(s) to merge these two dictionaries, creating a new dictionary that contains the keys and values from both of these dictionaries. Finally, your function should return the merged dictionary.

Important: Create a completely new dictionary rather than modifying one of the dictionaries that you are merging. To verify this, the tests will print the original dictionaries as well as the merged one.

Below is a description of a test to verify your code.

For this test, the following code will be executed after your code:

    habitats1 = {"duck": "pond", "horse": "field", "cow": "pasture"}

    habitats3 = {"student": "library", "trout": "lake", "shark": "ocean"}
    
    merged = mergeDictionaries(habitats1, habitats2)
    
    print("Original dictionaries:")
    print(habitats1)
    print(habitats2)

**Human:**
Here is a new Python programming task.

Please write a function called "mergeAndSumDictionaries" that accepts two arguments. Both of these arguments will be dictionaries. Your function should create a new dictionary that merges these two dictionaries. When both dictionaries have an element with the same key, the value in the new dictionary should be the sum of the values from the original two dictionaries.

Below is a description of a test to verify your code.

For this test, the following code will be executed after your code:

***

**Assistant:**

Here's the solution in Python:

```
def mergeAndSumDictionaries(dict1, dict2):
    result = {}
    for key in set(dict1.keys()) | set(dict2.keys()):
        result[key] = dict1.get(key, 0) + dict2.get(key, 0)
    return result

```

This solution uses the `|` operator to get the union of the keys of both dictionaries. For each key in the union, the value of that key from `dict1` and `dict2` is added and stored in a new dictionary `result`. The `dict.get` method is used to get the value of the key from the dictionary, and if the key is not present in the dictionary, it returns `0` (the second argument of `dict.get`).

***

**Assistant:**

Here is the implementation of the function `containsKeyValuePair`:

```
def containsKeyValuePair(dictionary, key, value):
    return key in dictionary and dictionary[key] == value

```

You can use the `in` operator to check if the `key` is present in the `dictionary`, and then use the `dictionary` access operator `[ ]` to retrieve the value associated with the `key`. Finally, you can compare the retrieved value with the `value` argument to determine if the `dictionary` contains the specified key/value pair.

Here is a new Python programming task.

Please write a function called "matchNumbersToSquares" that accepts a single argument: an integer value. Your function should build a dictionary that contains the same number of keys as indicated by the argument. The keys should start at 1 and increment up to (and including) the value of the argument. The value corresponding to each key should be the square of the key. For example, if this function were invoked as below:

    matchNumbersToSquares(3)

Your function would return the following dictionary:

    {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9}

Below is a description of a test to verify your code.

For this test, the following code will be executed after your code:

    result = matchNumbersToSquares(3)

***

**Assistant:**

Here is the implementation of the function `matchNumbersToSquares`:

```
def matchNumbersToSquares(n):
    return {i: i**2 for i in range(1, n+1)}

```

This function uses a dictionary comprehension to build the dictionary. The keys are generated using the range function, which generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`, inclusive. The values are calculated by squaring the keys. The final result is the dictionary comprehension that maps each key to its corresponding value.

Please write a function called "sumDictionaryValues" that accepts a single argument: a dictionary variable. The keys of this dictionary will be strings. The values of this dictionary will each be a list of numbers. Your function should create a new dictionary. The keys of the new dictionary should be the same as the keys of the original dictionary. The values of the new dictionary should be the sum of the respective values in the the original lists.

The tests will print the original dictionary to make sure that it has not been modified.

Below is the expected output:

    Input dictionary:
    {'G': [-1, -2, 3, 0, 4], 'H': [-11, -4, 15], 'I': [1]}
    Output dictionary:
    {'G': 4, 'H': 0, 'I': 1}

***

**Assistant:**

Here's the code to solve the problem:

```
def sumDictionaryValues(theDict):
    newDict = {}
    for key, value in theDict.items():
        newDict[key] = sum(value)
    return newDict

```

This function creates a new dictionary `newDict` and uses a for loop to iterate over the keys and values of `theDict`. The sum of the values of each key is calculated using the `sum` function and stored in `newDict` with the same key. The final `newDict` is returned.

Suppose you have traveled to the Uinta mountain range for a research project. You sit in various locations to observe animals throughout the day. At the end of your trip, your task is to tally how many times you have seen each animal for the entire trip across all the locations. Please write a function called "countAnimals" that accepts a single argument: a list of string values that represent the animals you observed. This list may contain duplicates of animals that you observed. Your function should create a dictionary that indicates how many times you observed each animal. The keys of your dictionary should be animal names. The values of your dictionary should be the number of sightings for those animals. For example, if you had observed 2 deer, 2 ducks, and a bear, your dictionary would be something like this: "{"deer": 2, "duck": 2, "bear": 1}". After creating your dictionary and populating these values, please return the dictionary.

Below is a description of a test to verify your code.

For this test, the following code will be executed after your code:

    animals = ["deer", "deer", "deer", "duck", "deer", "moose", "rabbit", "rabbit", "deer", "deer", "bear"]
    
    print(countAnimals(animals))

Below is the expected output:

    {'deer': 6, 'duck': 1, 'moose': 1, 'rabbit': 2, 'bear': 1}

    {'deer': 1, 'snake': 1, 'rabbit': 1, 'duck': 1, 'moose': 1, 'bear': 1}

Below is a description of a test to verify your code.

For this test, the following code will be executed after your code:

    animals = ["deer"]  10 + ["moose"]  5 + ["mouse"]  732
    
    print(countAnimals(animals))

Below is the expected output:

    {'deer': 10, 'moose': 5, 'mouse': 732}

**Assistant:**

Here is one possible implementation of the function `countAnimals` in Python:

```
def countAnimals(animals):
    animal_count = {}
    for animal in animals:
        if animal in animal_count:
            animal_count[animal] += 1
        else:
            animal_count[animal] = 1
    return animal_count

```

This function uses a dictionary `animal_count` to keep track of the count of each animal. For each animal in the input list `animals`, if the animal is already in the dictionary, its count is incremented by 1. If it is not, a new entry is created with a count of 1. At the end, the dictionary is returned as the result of the function.

Here is a new Python programming task.

Please write a function called "convertDictionaryToList" that accepts a single argument: a dictionary variable. Your function should build and return a nested list variable that contains the contents of the dictionary, sorted by key.

For example, if the input dictionary were the following:

    {"cat": 3, "badger": 5, "parrot": 1}

Your return value would be:

    [["badger", 5], ["cat", 3], ["parrot", 1]]

Below is a description of a test to verify your code.

For this test, the following code will be executed after your code:

    animalWeights = { "dog": 45.2, "cat": 22.9, "monkey": 33.3, "turkey": 28.8}
    
    print(convertDictionaryToList(animalWeights))

Below is the expected output:

    [['cat', 22.9], ['dog', 45.2], ['monkey', 33.3], ['turkey', 28.8]]

Below is a description of a test to verify your code.

For this test, the following code will be executed after your code:

    treeHeights = { "cactus": 15.4, "grass": 2.1, "sunflower": 18.4, "pine": 118.7}
    
    print(convertDictionaryToList(treeHeights))

Below is the expected output:

    [['cactus', 15.4], ['grass', 2.1], ['pine', 118.7], ['sunflower', 18.4]]

Suppose you had weather data for various cities in various years and that you wanted to identify the maximum temperature across all the cities and years.

Please write a function called "getNestedMax" that accepts a single argument: a dictionary variable. Each key of this dictionary will be a string (city name). Each value will be a (nested) dictionary. Each key in the nested dictionaries will be an integer (year). Each value in the nested dictionaries will be a number (temperature). Your function should check all the nested dictionaries and identify the maximum temperature across the nested dictionaries. Your function should return the overall maximum.

Below is a description of a test to verify your code.

For this test, the following code will be executed after your code:

    rainCityNested = {"Omaha": {2013: 13.2, 2014: 14.5}, "Miami": {2013: 88.4, 2014: 75.3}}
    
    print(getNestedMax(rainCityNested))

Below is the expected output:

    88.4

Below is a description of a test to verify your code.

For this test, the following code will be executed after your code:

    rainCityNested = {"Provo": {2013: 15.2, 2014: 25.4}, "Dallas": {2013: 34.8, 2014: 40.2}}
    
    print(getNestedMax(rainCityNested))

Below is the expected output:

    40.2

Below is a description of a test to verify your code.

For this test, the following code will be executed after your code:

    rainCityNested = {"Moab": {2013: 35.2, 2014: 35.4, 2015: 37.7}, "Kanab": {2013: 34.8, 2014: 36.2, 2015: 39.4}, "Green River": {2013: 36.4, 2014: 38.3, 2015: 38.2}}
    
    print(getNestedMax(rainCityNested))

Below is the expected output:

    39.4

***

**Assistant:**

Here is the implementation for the function "getNestedMax":

```
def getNestedMax(dictionary):
    max_temp = float("-inf")
    for city_dict in dictionary.values():
        for temp in city_dict.values():
            max_temp = max(max_temp, temp)
    return max_temp

```

This function loops through the values of the dictionary, which are the nested dictionaries. For each nested dictionary, it loops through its values, which are the temperatures, and updates the maximum temperature by taking the maximum value between the current maximum and the current temperature. Finally, it returns the overall maximum temperature.

Here is a new Python programming task.

In a lab, researchers often seek to grow bacterial colonies. If bacteria have not grown to 500 CFUs (colony-forming units) after 3 days, the scientists will throw away the bacterial samples. Please write a function called "identifyColoniesToKeep". This function should accept two arguments. Both of these arguments will be dictionaries that will contain information about the bacterial colonies. In the first dictionary, the keys will be the names of bacterial species. The values in this dictionary will be the current number of CFUs for each species. In the second dictionary, the keys will also be names of bacterial species. The dictionary values will indicate the growth rate for each of these species.

For example, if the growth rate for Alysiella crassa were 0.5, that would indicate that the number of bacteria would increase by 50% each day. Assuming that all bacterial cultures you are currently growing in the lab have three more days to grow, write code that will identify which bacteria will not be thrown out. Your function should return a list that contains the names of these bacteria. Before returning the list, sort the names in alphabetical order.

Hint(s):

    The math on this problem might be a little tricky. First, calculate the number of bacteria after one day as the original number multiplied by one plus the growth rate. Next, take that number and multiply it by one plus the growth rate; that is the number of bacteria after the second day. Then, take that number and multiply it by one plus the growth rate; that is the number of bacteria after the third day.

Below is a description of a test to verify your code.

For this test, the following code will be executed after your code:

    currentCFUs1 = {"Alysiella crassa": 200, "Asaia bogorensis": 50, "Alishewanella fetalis": 450}
    
    growthRates1 = {"Alysiella crassa": 0.5, "Asaia bogorensis": 0.99, "Alishewanella fetalis": 0.03}
    
    print(identifyColoniesToKeep(currentCFUs1, growthRates1))

Below is the expected output:

    ['Alysiella crassa']

Below is a description of a test to verify your code.

For this test, the following code will be executed after your code:

    currentCFUs2 = {"Streptococcus mutans": 10, "Lactococcus lactis": 400, "Actinomyces israelii": 350, "Azotobacter vinelandii": 5}
    
    growthRates2 = {"Lactococcus lactis": 0.05, "Streptococcus mutans": 2.5, "Azotobacter vinelandii": 5.0, "Actinomyces israelii": 1.00}
    
    print(identifyColoniesToKeep(currentCFUs2, growthRates2))

Below is the expected output:

    ['Actinomyces israelii', 'Azotobacter vinelandii']

***

**Assistant:**

Here is a solution in Python to the problem:

```
def identifyColoniesToKeep(currentCFUs, growthRates):
    coloniesToKeep = []
    for species, CFUs in currentCFUs.items():
        growthFactor = 1 + growthRates[species]
        for i in range(3):
            CFUs *= growthFactor
        if CFUs >= 500:
            coloniesToKeep.append(species)
    coloniesToKeep.sort()
    return coloniesToKeep

```

The function `identifyColoniesToKeep` takes in two dictionaries as input arguments. It loops through the first dictionary and for each species, calculates its growth factor by adding 1 to its growth rate from the second dictionary. Then, it multiplies the initial number of CFUs with the growth factor for three days to simulate the growth of the bacteria. Finally, it checks if the total number of CFUs after three days is greater than or equal to 500. If it is, the species name is appended to the `coloniesToKeep` list. After the loop is finished, the list is sorted in alphabetical order and returned as the output.
